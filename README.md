👋 Hi, I'm @Harshit691999 (but you can call me Harsh, no need to be formal)!

👀 What am I into? Well, let's just say if development was a pizza, I'd be the guy eating it (yes, I’m that into it). Currently diving deep into C++/SFML and figuring out game development like I’m in an epic quest. 🎮

🌱 Currently learning? Oh, just a casual stroll through C++ and SFML – don’t mind me, just slaying some game development concepts and trying to create my own digital kingdom. (Spoiler: There’s a lot of “Hello World” involved.) 😅

📫 How to reach me? You can hit me up via email at harshit.gupta111299@gmail.com – I check it way more often than I check my fridge for snacks.

😄 Pronouns? Him/He (but if you want to call me “the programming wizard” or “master of the code universe,” I’ll accept that too).

⚡ Fun Fact: I’m actually new to the programming world (cue dramatic music). I know my profile might look like a seasoned coder, but trust me, it’s all smoke and mirrors. I’m just here trying not to break everything while learning. 😎
